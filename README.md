## What is this?
This is the final project for my IS4600 class. It's a tiny Web application that
gives you a small quiz about a planned project and recommends tools based on the
requirements of that project.

## Demo
WIP

## Develop
Here are some instructions if you want to develop this project yourself.

Clone the Repository:

    $ git clone git@github.com:joshsamara/PMQuiz.git

Install the requirements

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application

    $ ./application.py

View the application in a web browser. By default it will be at
`localhost:5000`
